                I sent an email to each team member after the grouping situation came out, introduced myself and asked everyone about what software we should use to communicate and gave them my suggestions and software links. Byron and Dane replied to me and set up a team on the MS team. We started to discuss and hold meetings on the MS team to discuss the allocation of work. Later, Zain joined the team and took the task, There was no more contact after. The other two members of the team, Cameron Jones, replied an email to express that they wanted to join in the assignment work. After that, they didn't reply ever again and didn't join MS team. Even though we had added him in, Kadin didn't show up at all.<br><br>
         In the part of work, I was responsible for Industry data and Ideal job, and all the team's web pages. This was originally Dane's work, but because we really had too few members working, we decided to take over after discussion. Dane was responsible for the part of project idea, and I also completed the construction, upload and update of the GitHub repository.
    As for the team, I organised three meetings. Dane and Byron attended the meeting. Zain attended once, but there was no news any more. His task, IT Technology, has not been completed. We all have other tasks and have no time to fill his holes.<br><br>
         I uploaded several templates of my work and web design in MS team, and chatted with team to discuss many details of my work.
    After the completion of our respective work, I uploaded them to Github without uploading it separately, so Github did not accurately reflect our work assignment.
